<p class="no-margin">Firstly, you have to select <b>which integration will be used to create verification sessions.</b></p>
<p class="no-margin">NOTE: Verification sessions will be processed by Veriff <b>only within Live integrations,</b> so if you are creating a session while testing or in a Production environment - make sure that you select a <b>Live </b>integration. To understand the differences between a Live integration and a test integration, please refer to <a class="intercom-content-link" href="https://help.veriff.com/en/articles/3430228-what-are-integrations-and-how-to-create-them" target="_blank">this article</a>.<br/>​<br/>After you have selected an integration, you have the option to pre-filll <b>the first </b>and<b> the last name</b> of the person you are creating the session for, however this is completely optional as Veriff will be extracting the first and last name from the submitted document images, and returning it to you via API or via the Veriff Station UI. </p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">You are also able to add a unique ID, however it is also completely optional. It is up to you what you use as the unique identifier - it can be the User ID from your system, email address, order number, phone number or whatever unique ID you choose. <br/>​<br/>Click on <b>GENERATE VERIFICATION</b> and you will see the following screen</p>

<p class="no-margin">You are now given two options to start the verification session - you can either enter the verification flow by scanning the QR code with your camera OR by accessing the link directly. </p>
