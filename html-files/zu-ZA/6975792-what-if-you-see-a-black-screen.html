<ul>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">The most common reason for seeing a black screen is that some other service is using your device's camera. The camera's video service<b> can not be used by multiple applications simultaneously</b>. Please <b>make sure to close other applications</b> that might be using your camera. The same applies to applications that recently used your camera, but are still active and running. Some common applications include Skype, FaceTime, Messenger or any live streaming services. <b>After closing the other applications, please refresh the page or restart the device and try again.</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">It might be that your <b>camera's resolution is too low</b> to get a good quality pictures and our system is automatically blocking the camera. <b>The minimum requirement is 480px x 640px.</b> If your camera's resolution is lower that this, it's not possible to proceed and <b>we recommend using a different device.</b></p>
</li>

<p class="no-margin">A black screen instead of the camera stream is also shown when <b>the browser used is not supported</b>.
