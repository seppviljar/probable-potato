<html><head><title>Resubmission Limit Exceeded</title></head><body><h1>Resubmission Limit Exceeded</h1><p class="no-margin">Ideally, each and every submitted verification should receive a decision on the first try. However, there are instances where this is not possible. For example, due to issues such as very low document or selfie image quality, a decision can't be given, and the session is resubmitted until the captured images are of a good enough quality to enable a decisive decision status.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Sometimes, this in itself can be an issue. For example, if the individual's device is the source of the problem, there isn't a possible resolution even after a resubmission which can result in a resubmission loop.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Veriff's Resubmission limit is meant to ensure that an end user doesn't get stuck on such a negative loop. In addition, when on the Enterprise Plan, this also means you have control over the amount of resubmission's your customer's can make when getting verified.</p>

<h1 id="h_9661741d71">How Does It Work?</h1>
<p class="no-margin">If your end-user has been prompted to resubmit 9 times during the same session &amp; using the same session ID, their 10th attempt will be automatically declined.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">The decline would simply occur as a result of reaching the resubmission limit and they will not be able to make any further resubmissions on that session.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>

<h2 id="h_e1ab35c382">Reason / Granular Code</h2>
<p class="no-margin">When a session gets declined due to the resubmission limit being exceeded, the decline reason code will be: </p>
<p class="intercom-align-center no-margin">"539" - "Resubmission limit exceeded"</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">This granular reason code is also noted in our <a class="intercom-content-link" href="https://developers.veriff.com/#grc-verification-decision-declined" target="_blank">developer's documentation guide here</a>.</p></body></html>
