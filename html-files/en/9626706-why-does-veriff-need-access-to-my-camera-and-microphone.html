We canâ€™t verify your identity without these photos.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">If instructed by the client, we may sometimes also need to access your camera and microphone to video and sound record the verification session. This fraud prevention measure enables us to ensure you are present during the verification session.We only need access to your camera and microphone during the identification process.</p>
<p class="no-margin"><br/>Recording begins once permission is granted, and we will stop recording once the photos are submitted at the end of the verification process. You are then free to change your permissions again in your device or browser settings. Granting these permissions is voluntary, however without permissions Veriff might not be able to verify your identity via our service.</p></body></html>
