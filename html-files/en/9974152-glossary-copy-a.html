<p class="no-margin">API Key - A unique identifier of an integration and a required parameter for authentication. It is used to create the X-AUTH-CLIENT header value for API requests. You can find it in the Veriff environment &gt; Integration's page (requires a login). Occasionally, referred to as the API public key or Publishable key.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>

<p class="no-margin">AttemptId - An UUID v4 of a specific attempt. You can find its value in your GET /sessions/{sessionId}/attempts response, as {verification.id}. In the API requests\' context, an "attempt" is one step (uploading required data and getting a decision) inside a verification session, and it can be made several times during a verification session. This means that calling the GET /sessions/{sessionId}/attempts can return several {verification} objects, each one with a unique {id} value.</p>

<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Live Integration - Integration which is created as per your requirements. It is used for production and verification sessions created will count towards paid usage. For live integration sessions, the sessions' statuses are set automatically. You need to define the Webhook decisions URL in Station (see here for instructions).</p>

You can find its value in the response payload of your POST session, as verification.id. In the API requests' context, one verification session comprises many steps (uploading data, uploading images, getting a decision, etc.). You can call several endpoints using the same {sessionID}, to get all kinds of different data from that specific session.</p>

<p class="no-margin">Verification session - One verification session from start to end, i.e., from the moment a session is created until the moment a conclusive decision (“approved”, “declined”, “expired”/”abandoned”) is granted.
