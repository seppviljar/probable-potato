If it does not or if you are using a computer, here are a few things that should help the camera focus better:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Make sure that <b>the light</b> is coming from <b>the back of the camera</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Use <b>contrast background. </b>Darker background for light documents and vice-versa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin">Take a picture from<b> further away</b>. This way it is easier to get your camera to focus, but be careful to not zoom out too much as the picture might come out blurry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="no-margin"><b>Switch cameras</b>. Although normally your device's back camera makes better quality pictures than the front camera, it might not work properly and it is possible that you get a better picture with the front camera</p>
